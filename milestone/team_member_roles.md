# Team Member List and Roles

## Harrison Cusack (45375008)
Harrison will be primarily responsible for establishing the Bluetooth Mesh connection between Thingy:52 devices. This will involve incorporating the Zephyr Bluetooth Mesh network driver file, enabling each Thingy:52 to 1) flood the mesh network with request packets (directed at a specified addressee) for sensor data, 2) ignore request packets if the request has already been received, and 3) gather and send back requested sensor data to the requestor. Furthermore, the code from Practical 1 (i.e. weather station functionality) will be ported over to the current project's code, and will be used to define a custom configuration server in the mesh code (replacing generic configuration servers in the example code, such as turning an LED on/off). This will allow for weather data to be retrieved from any Thingy:52 device in the mesh network.
